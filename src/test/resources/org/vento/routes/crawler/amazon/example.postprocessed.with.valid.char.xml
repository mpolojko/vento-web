        <text>I've had an iPad since it first came out last April. I really love that device, but the one area in which the iPad really lacked was reading eBooks. While the application iBooks is pretty slick, reading eBooks on the iPad's LED backlit display is extremely tough on the eyes. I am easily able to read websites, RSS feeds, etc., but to sit down and read for an extended period as I usually do with books is extremely difficult. So I decided to buy a Kindle. This is definitely one of the better purchases I've made (after switching to Mac of course).THE GOOD:- I read a lot and usually during my commute to work. Standing on the subway trying to handle a big hardcover - the last book I read was 750 pages - is extremely difficult. With the iPad reading War and Peace is as easy as reading a small book.-The screen quality and the contrast is so amazing - there is zero eye strain on the device. I can read for hours without seeing a difference between reading on the Kindle or an actual book.-The battery life can last for 30 days when the internet is turned off. That battery life is unbelievable. I don't have to worry about constantly plugging it in like my phone or the iPad. I can leave it in my bag just like a traditional book and charge it every so often.-Have you ever been reading a book away from home and then you finish... What are supposed to do? You didn't bring a second book, and now you're out and bookless. Well with the Kindle you can store multiple books on it and never run out of reading. That is definitely a great improvement over traditional books.THE BAD:-My biggest gripe with the Kindle (all eBooks in general actually) is that you cannot download eBook copies of paper books that you already own. If you buy a CD you can put the digital version of those songs on your iPod, why can't you put the digital version of a book you own on your own Kindle device?-The quality of images aren't the best. During books if you come across an image the quality is significantly worse than the "picture page" from a traditional book or even from the iPad. However, this isn't such a big problem as most books I read don't have that many images and text quality is obviously more important.I decided to buy the WiFi only Kindle. With such a low price it's definitely a great deal. In my opinion the 3G isn't that necessary - just load up your Kindle with books at home or Starbucks or work and save yourself some money.Lastly, with the Kindle I bought the Amazon Non-Lighted cover. Due to some kind of manufacturing problem that cover kept causing my Kindle to reboot - almost daily. After reading on some forums that the cover could be the culprit - it has metal prongs that plug into the side of the device - I took the Kindle out of the cover. After three days the Kindle hasn't rebooted once. I've heard that the Lighted Cover does not have this problem and have ordered one.</text>

        <text>Seemed very nice out of the box, but the top half of the screen wigged out before the thing had to be recharged. Looking around its a VERY common prob. You pays your money and you takes your chances. I'll bet replacing it is going to be a hassle.</text>

        <text>Tried out the competitors ebook readers. The other brands took some time to figure out, how to navigate. The Kindle was immediately usable. It was intuitive. The screen was easy to read and easy on the eyes. What a wonderful product!</text>

        <text>No comments on the Kindle itself - it is one of those rare things where the hype should be believed, it has changed my reading habits and made me go through more books much faster; I am writing a short review of the excellent Amazon service.I live in Japan, and when I first ordered the Kindle it took about five days to get here; after about six weeks, the screen froze (not entirely sure how that happened) and I thought I was going to have to go through sixteen different screens of convoluted legalese just to understand how I could possibly get a replacement, maybe. Instead, when I asked to be called by Amazon service, I received a call precisely five minutes later (and on Thanksgiving morning at 7 am!), the conversation took three minutes, during which I was told I would be sent a replacement right away, then three and a half days later I had a new Kindle in the mail.Outstanding.Here's hoping Amazon keep up the good work.</text>

        <text>I love the Kindle 3 and recommend it for reading books, but there is one disappointing bug in text to speech, and I don't understand why it is not easily fixed.The reading does not pause after paragraphs or headings.  Instead of a longer pause at the end of a paragraph than at the end of a regular sentence, there is no pause at all.  The result is that the first sentence in a paragraph is read as a continuation of the last sentence of the previous paragraph.  Just the opposite of what the author intended.A few other reviewers have mentioned this bug, but they don't seem to be that concerned about it.  To me, it pretty much makes text to speech useless.  Maybe the lack of pause between paragraphs is ok for reading novels, but for a substantive book it makes comprehension almost impossible.They have pretty much solved the hard part -- text recognition and pronunciation.  It would seem easy to insert an extra pause when there is a blank line on the page.</text>

        <text>I've had this for about one month and am using it almost every day.  I was considering the DX but am glad I went for the smaller size as I will likely use it primarily for text and the size/weight are almost ideal for that.  I don't have a data plan for my phone, so I love the free 3G for occasional access to the web when away from home to check mail, comparison shop, get a map or whatever.  The 3G transfer rate seems quite slow, the browser has some limits and navigation is clumsy but overall is acceptable for limited use.Wishlist:- Greater variety of ebooks- Touchscreen but keep the page navigation buttons.- Buttons for numbers or at least labels for the top row shortcuts- Better support for music (e.g. playlist, skip, shuffle)- User-defined screen savers (Emily Dickinson portrait is frightening)</text>

        <text>last week a friend of mine wanted to know about Kindles, i answered happily with my love of my new Kindle, then i read a comment from a anti Kindle friend of hers that said " kindles are for old grannies that cant turn the pages of real books"well here i am.. not old, not a granny and i can turn pages of REAL books just fine, why did i choose to get a Kindle? i cant FIT any more books in this apartment and don't want to stop reading anytime soon thats why and when i say i read, i mean if i could not do anything BUT i'd read all the time just because i love stories so much. i have bookcases that are stuffed with books, Kindle has given me a wonnnnderful little device to read now, the 3g connection is awesome and quick to download, the screen is easy to read, its easy to hold, much easier than an actual book, and yes you have to be careful with it, you cant drop it or get it wet, but its not difficult to do so, it also has given me a new love Scrabble which i've never played until the Kindle. my family growing up were monopoly not Scrabble players. i also love the blogs on the kindle the newpapers and magazines, and the old books and the book choices available for some really good deals, plus the opportunity to read samples of books before you decide to purchase.. in all.. i love my Kindle. i'm so happy with my purchase.</text>

        <text>I absolutely ADORE my Kindle. It is completely amazing, I love it so much! I've been using it for schoolwork and fun reading, and it's so lightweight I forget I'm holding it when I'm reading (unlike paperbacks which I constantly fuss with). The e-ink is great, and the words are so crisp and clear it's like I'm reading them from the clearest, neatest paper! I also love the wireless and 3G, I can share quotes from books and look up stuff no matter where I am! I love it! I'm always creating little notes and highlights for myself for later, and I love the free word games for the Kindle! The whole thing is great, definitely the best e-reader on the market (I'll argue with anyone who says otherwise)! I love it, it was worth every penny!</text>

        <text>I love books and as a result, wasn't sure I would like the Kindle. I was wrong. I love it! The Kindle is an e-reader... that's all it is... that's all it's meant to be... and that's the beauty of it. It was designed for one primary purpose, and it fulfils that purpose extremely well. It's very lightweight and easy to handle. The e-ink presentation is easy to read and very easy on the eyes. I highly recommend this device to anyone that loves to read.</text>
